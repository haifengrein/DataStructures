# DataStructures Repository

This repository contains implementations of common data structures in Python, Java, and C/C++. Each data structure is implemented in all three languages to provide a comparative understanding and practical reference.

## Goals
- Develop and demonstrate proficiency in implementing data structures
- Provide a multi-language reference for common data structures
